Story
^^^^^

| As a developer
| I want to define the application domain models |
| So that I can setup the rest of the program around them

Validation Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Given the application module has been defined
| When I instantiate any of the models in it
| Then they will have all their attributes defined
